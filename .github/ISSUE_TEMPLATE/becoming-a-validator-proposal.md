## Becoming a Validator Proposal
### How many nodes do you plan to run?

*If you are willing to run more than 1 node, please share your strategy if you have any. Do you plan to run them with different configuration? How do you plan to compare them? We will be happy if you share any details of your experiments here in the comments.*

### Why do you want to run a validator node on StatelessNet?

### What region(s) do you plan to run on?
