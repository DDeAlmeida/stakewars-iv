# NEAR Stake Wars IV: Attack of Transactions

NEAR Protocol is preparing a major update of the core protocol architecture that takes scalability to the next level. This update is called stateless validation, and it has ample impact on how the network operates internally. We invite everyone to join an early access network that runs on this new architecture, StatelessNet, and run a stateless validator node or test the network throughput and scalability.

## Timeline

The entire duration of NEAR Stake Wars IV will be approximately two months, from February till April 2024.
See the detailed timeline [here](TIMELINE.md).
